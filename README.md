The "Important Notes" page has important information in regards to requirements for the library.** 

Download and Install
-------------------------------------------------
MySQL Connector 1.0.5 can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/smokeypell/Arduino_ESP8266-MySQL-Connector). To install, download the zip file, uncompress it, then copy the mysql-connector folder to your Libraries folder. Under Windows this would be "Documents/Arduino/libraries".

**Note:**
* In order to be used with the Arduino, this library requires the SHA1 library. The SHA1 library can also be downloaded from GitHub [here](https://github.com/Cathedrow/Cryptosuite).
* Close the Arduino IDE and then copy the folders, otherwise you will have to restart it to use the new library.


Documentation
